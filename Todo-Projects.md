# ToDo Projects
Before you embark on a project, count the cost, whether you have enough to get it to a significant and usable level.

You don't have to implement all features at a time. Leave room for later growth and improvement, thereby promoting spaced-repetition. This helps you develop extensibility and maintainability skills.

Above all, **select really good and convincing projects**.

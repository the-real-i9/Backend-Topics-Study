# Aim
A Frontend of an application, that's <u>not detailed in design</u>.

## How?
Don't style content the app merely renders, just display JSON and minimally styled structure

Only style, those user interactions that makes API calls to the backend.

Ignore unnecessary content and UX. Only care about what the backend renders and the interactions that make calls to the backend.

Look at the features you choose to provide (according to Chat-GPT answers), see how social media structures them, and quickly decide on one structure.

**But, But** --- let it be opened to better styling, since you may have time later.

## Four things are involved
Modeling App navigation

Rendering responses as JSON code block(s).

Designing & Attaching `GET` and `DELETE` request interactive buttons.

Designing & Rendering `POST`, `PUT` and `PATCH` request forms or buttons.

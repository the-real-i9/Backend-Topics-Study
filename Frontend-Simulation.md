# Objective
A Frontend of an application, that's <u>not detailed in design</u>.

# Strategy
- App's navigation, layout, and hierarchical UI structure should be as it should.
- Simple-design static content should use existing CSS while complex ones should just render JSON data
- Interactive content such as forms and buttons should be styled as they should
- Complex interface implementations such as "Create Post" and "Add product" should be basic. Just supply input fields
- Don't hide any actions under a disclosure, display all available options straight up.
- Unless you decide to fully design specific parts of the application, where it's really worth it.

> Note!!! This doesn't apply to core web applications created to achieve tasks, involving 100% interactive content.

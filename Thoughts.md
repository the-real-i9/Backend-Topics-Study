# Tips
Start learning from the often used concepts, gradually to the sparingly used concepts.

**Focus first on the concepts/topics highlighted in the backend developer roadmap**, and defer the rest for later, whilst studying a broad knowledge base. 
- You don't want to finish a whole database textbook, when there are priority concepts that are used everyday, highlighted in the roadmap.

Don't just do a run-through study, focus on one thing at a time and make sure to examine yourself on the things meant to be understood. **Come up with questions that require explanation from the topic, and write/speak on them**.

You can create mini-projects to demostrate concepts as you go, ones you can use in a tutorial/content.

**NOTE:** Your online content is also part of your portfolio.

# Effective Learning
**Step 1:** Study a topic (Textbook -> Roadmap Articles/Videos)
- Derive article topics as you study.
- Derive/Set explanatory questions

**Step 2:** Practice necessary implementation

**Step 3:** Write on that topic
- Write like you're teaching with talk, be humane in your explanation.
- Be less academic.
- Explain very cleary and practically, in the way you've understood the topic, with the scenarios and expamples you've painted. **You get the idea.**
- Be known for this writing style.

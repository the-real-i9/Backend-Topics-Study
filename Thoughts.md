# Tips
Start learning from the often used concepts, gradually to the sparingly used concepts.

**Focus first on the concepts/topics highlighted in the backend developer roadmap**, and defer the rest for later, whilst studying a broad knowledge base. 
- You don't want to finish a whole database textbook, when there are priority concepts that are used everyday, highlighted in the roadmap.

Don't just do a run-through study, focus on one thing at a time and make sure to examine yourself on the things meant to be understood. **Come up with questions that require explanation from the topic, and write/speak on them**.

You can create mini-projects to demostrate concepts as you go, ones you can use in a tutorial/content.

**NOTE:** Your online content is also part of your portfolio.

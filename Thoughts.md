# Tips
Start learning from the often used concepts, gradually to the sparingly used concepts.

**Focus first on the concepts/topics highlighted in the backend developer roadmap**, and defer the rest for later, whilst studying a broad knowledge base. 
- You don't want to finish a whole database textbook, when there are priority concepts that are used everyday, highlighted in the roadmap.

Don't just do a run-through study, focus on one thing at a time and make sure to examine yourself on the things meant to be understood. **Come up with questions that require explanation from the topic, and write/speak on them**.

You can create mini-projects to demostrate concepts as you go, ones you can use in a tutorial/content.

**NOTE:** Your online content is also part of your portfolio.

# Current Steps
- Linux {Deferred}
- Languages: C, Go (`*1`), Rust {Deferred}
  - Networking modules, Language Backend frameworks
  - Implementation of REST, GraphQL, WebSockets, gRPC, and other [API development implementations](./Learn/HTTP--API-dev/API-dev/Implementations.md#basic).
- Software design and Architecture
  - Design and principles, Architectural patterns, Design patterns, Clean code
- API Design & Building
  - Build projects as a practical means of learning API design
  - Create content based on concepts applied and tools used in the project
  
  > ----- While doing the above -----
  - English training: Building English Expertise
  - Per book: One section per day on revision

- Create your Portfolio {After 3 or 4 projects}
- **Dive deep into/Focus on:** Content Creation (Online Presence, Knowledge sharing | Open Source Contribution | Community Participation)
  - Continue to create projects to learn more. Add the cool ones to portfolio. Create content based on concepts applied and tools used in the project
  - Continue your learning. Update your knowledge.
  - Continue to Pursue Excellence and Build competence, through exhausting API creation challenges
  - Continue the <u>**Career Growth/Climbing**</u> and **Self-Development**.
  - **In summary:** Commence your [career growth](../../../My%20Ideas/TheBiggerPicture.md), pursuing excellence, building competence, influencing the community, networking, online presence.

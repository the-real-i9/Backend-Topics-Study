# A typical HTTP session
In client-server protocols, like HTTP, sessions consists of three phases:
1. The client establishes a TCP (or the appropriate connection if the transport layer is not TCP).
2. The client sends its request, and waits for the answer.
3. The server processes the request, sending back its answer, providing a status code and appropriate data.

As of HTTP/1.1, the connection is no longer closed after completing the third phase, and the client is now granted a further request: this means the second and third phases can now be performed any number of times.

# My general workflow for upcoming projects
> **❗❗❗ Remember:** The goal of the API is to demonstrate your skills in the different aspects of backend development.

> These steps are in no way straightforward. In practical, you go back and forth as you refine your decisions.

### Step 1: Describe the API
Write a brief description of your API.

### Step 2: List all the API's affordances
- Research on the Apps Information Architecture
- What your app allows users to do
- All app features

### Step 3: Determine your API Architecture; Backend services/integrations
- Research on Architectural patterns, Architectural styles and Design patterns. Cient-Server? Event-driven? Microservices? MVC? etc.

- What backend services are you gonna integrate?: Database? Load balancers? Caches? CDNs? Compressors? Data manipulators? etc.

### Step 4: Draw Architectural diagrams
- Create architectural diagrams based on the previous step
- End-to-End diagrams, Component diagrams, Sequence diagrams
> You can skip this part for the time being.

### Step 5: Create API blueprint and specification
Open API specification, API blueprint

### Step 6: Verify the design; Mock and Prototype; Review
This helps you interact with your API visually

> You can skip this step, if you'll do step 7

### Step 7: Create the Frontend simulation
Create the frontend simulation of your App

### Step 8: Develop API using a language/framework of choice
- Go through the API development process
- Take [Step 3](#step-3-determine-your-api-architecture-backend-servicesintegrations) into account.

### Step 9: Test your API and Fix bugs

### Step 10: Deployment

### Step 11: Monitoring and Growth

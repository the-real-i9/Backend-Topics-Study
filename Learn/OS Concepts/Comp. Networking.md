# Protocols and Layers

## Layers

Data communication networks rely on *layered* protocols.

<u>Processes running on a system</u> and the communication ports that send and receive network bits <u>are logically connected by a series of layers</u>, <u>each performing one major function of the networking task.</u>

Each layer in the protocol stack has a distinct purpose and function. Each protocol layer handles part of the overall task.

### Protocol Layers

Each layer has a separate function in the overall task of moving bits between processes.

As long as the boundary functions between adjacent layers are respected, **(due to the decoupled nature)** ðŸ‘‰ layers can be changed or even completely rewritten without having to change the whole application. <u></u>Layers can be combined for efficiency, "mixed-and-matched" from different vendors, or customized for different circumstances, all without having to rework the entire stack from top to bottom.

### The TCP/IP Layers

The stack constst of protocols, not implementations, so decribing a layer or protocols says almost nothing about how these things should actually be built.

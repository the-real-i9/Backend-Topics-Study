> Database System Development Lifecycle

# The Information Systems Lifecycle

> **Information system:**\
**<u>The resources</u>** that <u>enable the collection, management, control, and dissemination of information throughout an organization</u>.

A computer-based information system includes a **database**, **database software**, **application software**, **computer hardware**, and **personnel** using and developing the system.

<u>The database</u> is a fundamental component of an information system, and <u>its development and usage</u> should be <u>**viewed from the perspective of the wider requirements of the organization**</u>.

The <u>stages in the lifecycle of an information **(database)** system</u> include: 
- **planning**, 
- **requirements collection and analysis**,
- **design**, 
- **prototyping**, 
- **implementation**, 
- **testing**, 
- **converson**, and 
- **operational maintenance**.

# The Database System Development Lifecycle
The stages of the database system development lifecycle are not strictly sequential, but invlolve some amount of repetiition of previous stages through *feedback loops*.

## Database Planning
> **Database planning:**\
The management activities that <u>allow the stages of the DSCLC to be realized</u> as efficiently and effectively as possible.

An important <u>first step</u> is to clearly **define the <u>mission statement</u> for the database system**.
- This mission statement defines <u>the major aims of the database system</u>.
- It helps to clarify <u>the purpose of the database system</u> and provide a clearer path towards the efficient and effective creation of the required database system.

The <u>next activity</u> involves **identifying the <u>mission objectives</u>**.
- Each mission objective should identify <u>a particular task that the database system must support</u>.

The mission statememt may be accompanied by some additional information that specifies in general terms **the work to be done**, **the resources with which to do it**, and **the money to pay for it all**.

Database planning should also include the development of standards that govern how data will be collected, how the format should be specified, what documentation will be needed, and how design and implementation shoudl proceed.

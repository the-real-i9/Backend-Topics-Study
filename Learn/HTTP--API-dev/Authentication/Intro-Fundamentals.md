# What is Authentication?

Authentication is user login.
- A mechanism that verifies/validates that a user is a registered user of an application, so that it can access protected resources.
- It is done by the user in the UI, and it is followed by Authorization.

# What is Authorization?

Authorization is a mechanism that controls and restricts user access to protected resources on the server.
- Before a user accesses a protected resource, it has to be authorized by its credentials, the ones which were provided at authentication.
- It is done via the `Authorization` header.
